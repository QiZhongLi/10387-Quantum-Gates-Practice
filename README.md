I made this repo pulbic because my professor wanted this exercise to be public. Not sure why anyone would look at this but ok.

Main.py contains some basic definitions, such as one and two qubit gates. From there, anyone should be able to calculate any circuit they want by using a combination of kronecker products (np.kron) and matrix multiplications. I originally had these stuff on a Maple file so for this exercise, I basically moved everything from there to a Python file instead. I'll add some more stuff that I think would be useful tools and see where it goes from there.

If someone is really inclined on using a quantum circuit simulator, you're probably better off using quirk instead.
